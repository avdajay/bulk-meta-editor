Bulk updates the metadata such as the title, description, canonical url, and the indexing of a page.

== Description ==
Bulk updates the metadata such as the title, description, canonical url, and the indexing of a page. Created for most Web Developers and SEO Specialists who do website audits. **Currently supports Yoast** as of the moment.

This plugin was created a way to solve my problem to bulk update the metadata since I was doing SEO audit and implementation. [Learn more about the plugin here.](https://ariesdajay.com/bulk-meta-editor/)

PRO Version is still in development. It allows you to do more and supports WooCommerce out of the box and taxonomies such as categories and tags.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is PRO version coming? =
It\'s still in development. There might not be a specific date about its release, but it\'s coming very soon.

= Does WooCommerce supported? =
Yes, WooCommerce is supported is partially supported on the normal version. You can only bulk update the product pages. On PRO version, however, can fully support product categories and tags.

= Why taxonomies only available to PRO version? =
The plugin currently supports Yoast out of the box. Yoast has a different way of saving the metadata in the database. I have invested my time in finding the best and efficient solution to bulk update the metadata.
